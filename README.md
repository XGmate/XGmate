👋 Hi, I’m @XGmate
👀 I’m interested in aircraft trajectory control, aircraft vision, and the integration of embedded systems with AI.
🌱 I’m currently a master's student at Northwestern Polytechnical University, and recently I've been delving into the reinforcement learning control of unmanned aerial vehicles.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to my research interests, especially those that involve applying advanced control algorithms in real - world scenarios for unmanned aircraft systems.
